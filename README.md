Separate by Vertex Color Addon for Blender v3.6 LTS
=========================================

Overview
--------
This Blender addon is designed to help with the process of separating meshes by their vertex color,
which is particularly useful for **Stormworks modding**. The addon automatically splits a mesh into
multiple objects based on their vertex colors and offers options for additional optimization such as
merging vertices and limited dissolving geometry.

## Features
--------
- **Separate Mesh by Vertex Color**: Automatically splits your mesh into objects based on vertex colors.
- **Merge by Distance**: Option to merge vertices within a defined distance to clean up the mesh.
- **Limited Dissolve**: Option to dissolve vertices/edges based on an angle limit to reduce geometry.
- **Triangulate**: Option to convert all faces to triangles after the separation operation.
- **Edge Split**: Option to split faces along edges based on a specified angle to improve mesh structure.
- **Joining after Operation**: Option to join all separated objects back into one after the operation is complete.


Installation
--------
1. Download the addon file.
2. Open Blender.
3. Go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Add-ons** > **Install**.
4. Select the downloaded `.py` file.
5. Once installed, enable the addon by checking the box next to it in the Add-ons tab.

## Usage
--------
1. Open the **3D Viewport** in Blender.
2. Go to the **Tool** tab on the right sidebar.
3. Find the **Separate by Vertex Color** panel.
4. In **Object Mode**, select the object you want to work with.
5. Use the checkboxes:
   - **Merge by Distance**: If you want to merge vertices that are within a specified distance, enable this option.
   - **Limited Dissolve**: If you want to dissolve geometry based on the angle between faces, enable this option and specify the angle limit (default is 1 degree).
   - **Triangulate**: If you want to convert all faces to triangles after the separation, enable this option.
   - **Edge Split**: If you want to split faces along edges based on a specified angle, enable this option and set the angle for the split.
   - **Join Objects After Operation**: If you want to join all separated objects back into one after the operation, enable this option.
6. Click the **Separate by Vertex Color** button to separate the mesh into new objects.
   - If the boolean options are enabled, the merge, dissolve, triangulation, edge split, and joining actions will run automatically on the separated objects.
